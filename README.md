# **Zentyal Scripting**

The goal of this repository is to provide useful scripts to manage a Zentyal server.

A few consideration about the scripts:

* The scripts were tested in a Zentyal 6 server, although the script should work in a Zentyal 5 and probably in Zentyal 4 too.
* All the scripts were tested in a test environment, be caution before run them in a production environment.

The available script at this moment is the following:

1. **zentyal-mail-backup** -> This script will make a backup of your Mail module and/or Sogo module.
